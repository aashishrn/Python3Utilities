# Python3Utilities
This is a module to make coding in Python3 a bit less repetitive. There are a few functions to do some common stuff in supposedly very efficient way. It is just a start. So it is still taking its form.
I am trying to figure out how Python3 works and I guess implementation is the best way to do so.
